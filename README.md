HI,
My name is Adam, I am 29. I have started programming 2 years ago just beacuse I wanted to change my job. That time I used to learn a lot of about the HTML, CSS, JS, REACT, PHP.
I started and after few tutorials liked it, so decided to continue my carrer path with the coding. I'm not a proffesional but for sure I'm a ambitious. I like to know
how the code works and improve my skills with each new project. I like front-end side this is where I probably would like to start. I have finished two projects (JS and React).
Feel free to watch.
