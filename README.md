Hi, My name is Adam, I am 29. I have been started programming 2 years ago. That time I used to learn a lot about HTML, CSS, JS, REACT, PHP. I started, and after a few tutorials liked it, so decided to continue my carrier path with coding. I'm not a professional, but for sure I'm ambitious. I like to know how the code works and improve my skills with each new project. I like front-end side, this is where I probably would like to start. I have finished two projects (JS and React). Feel free to watch.
