Hi!

I'm a programmer with a great dose of ambition.
I like to know how the code works and improve my skills with each new project. 
Mainly I work on the front-end side, constantly learning new technologies.

- Typescript
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- React JS
- Bootstrap v5
- Visual Studio
- GitHub/GitLab
