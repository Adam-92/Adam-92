Hi!

I'm a programmer with a great dose of ambition.
I like to know how the code works and improve my skills with each new project. 
Mainly I work on the front-end side, constantly learning new technologies.

  - TypeScript
  - React JS 
  - React-Query
  - Axios
  - Material UI, Bootstrap
  - Chat GPT
  - GitLab/GitHub
  - Jira
